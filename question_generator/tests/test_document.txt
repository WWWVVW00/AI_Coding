Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Uses unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-means, PCA, DBSCAN

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Uses reward/penalty system
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: Dataset used to train the model
- Features: Input variables used for prediction
- Model: Mathematical representation of a real-world process
- Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Cross-validation: Technique to assess model performance
